    Our committee is compromised of 14 students from various year groups and we
    all work together to deliver fun and informative primary school sessions, as
    well as informational talks and courses for dental students. 


    We convene every week to coordinate primary school sessions and events which are carefully designed with our target audience in mind. We also collaborate with specialist within relevant dental fields to create these events.

        Firstly, I would like to give a warm welcome to any visitors to this
        website!

        My name is Yasmin and I am in my second year of dental schools at the University of Manchester. I set up MPDSS after identifying that I had (and still have) a vested interest in paediatric dentistry; but there were not many opportunities for me to learn about this speciality until later years. 


        I am committed to preventative dentistry and improving the oral health of students in the Manchester area. In particular, I have wanted to focus on educating primary school students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. I also have the aim of being able to open up the world of paediatric dentistry to any dental student at my University who is interested in learning more. 


        I am thoroughly excited to see where we can take this society and I look forward to leading the committee.

    Another paragraph just to make it even longer. How much more can I add to the paragraph before I run out of ideas? Is it one sentence more, or even two, I don't know if I have anymore.
