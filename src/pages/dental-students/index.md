      description: >-
        We offer a range of events and opportunities for Manchester dental
        students. We hope to share our passion for paediatric dentistry with as
        many students as possible!

    - heading: Becoming a volunteer
      description: >-
        Volunteers are vital to help with the running of our primary school
        sessions. Currently, we are only accepting Manchester University dental
        students into the volunteering workforce as we require all of our
        volunteers to have had an advanced DBS check.


        As we are a new society, we aim to start our oral health education sessions in a limited number of schools. Once we have established which aspects of our sessions work or could be improved, we will then expand our sessions to more primary schools in the Manchester area. 


        Therefore, there will be a limited number of volunteer vacancies in our first year of operation. We will advertise all volunteering vacancies on this website and on social media - please keep an eye out!

    - heading: Paediatric Specialist Talks
      link: paediatric-specialist-talks
      description: >-
        We are very excited to organise a host of talks for dental students,
        delivered by respected paediatric dentists! This is a great way for
        sutdents to learn more about the specilaity, which can introduce them to
        the speciality earlier on in their course or aid their pre-exisitng
        understanding of the speciality. 


        We welcome any speaker/topic suggestions from current students!


        We are making plans for these talks to be delivered in person, however, if this is not possible (due to the COVID-19 situation) then we will aim to deliver the talks online. Either way, we will ensure that the talks are both enagaing and informative.

      link: mixed-dentition-course
      description: >-
        Charting mixed dentition can be a daunting task for dental students -
        and even some qualified dentists! The variability in mixed dentition can
        make the task of charting, in a limited amount of time, confusing. We
        would like to improve the confidence dental students so that they feel
        comfrotable treating paediatric patients.


        Our course is being created by the President (Yasmin) and Vice President (Sabina), along with the expertise and assistance of Dr. Siobhan Barry - an experienced paediaric consultatnt at the University Dental Hospital of Manchester.
