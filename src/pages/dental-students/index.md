      description: >-
        We offer a range of events and opportunities for Manchester dental and
        oral health science students. We hope to share our passion for
        paediatric dentistry with as many students as possible!

      description: >-
        Volunteers are vital for the running of our primary school sessions.
        Currently, we are only accepting Manchester University dental and oral
        health science students into the volunteering workforce as we require
        all of our volunteers to have had an advanced DBS check.


        As we are a new society, we aim to start our oral health education sessions in a limited number of schools. Once we have established which aspects of our sessions work well/could be improved; we will then expand our sessions to more primary schools in the Manchester area. 


        Therefore, there will be a limited number of volunteer vacancies in our first year of operation. We will advertise all volunteering vacancies on this website and on social media - please keep an eye out!

      description: >-
        We are very excited to organise a host of talks for dental and oral
        health science students; delivered by respected paediatric dentists!
        This is a great way for students to learn more about the specilaity;
        which can introduce them to the speciality earlier on in their course or
        aid their pre-exisitng understanding of the speciality. 


        We welcome any speaker/topic suggestions from current students! Suggestions can be sent to mpdss@gmail.com to be picked up by our Speakers Co-ordinator (Saif).


        We are making plans for these talks to be delivered in person, however, if this is not possible (due to the COVID-19 situation) then we will aim to deliver the talks online. Either way, we will ensure that the talks are both engaging and informative.

      link: mixed-dentition-course
      description: >-
        Charting mixed dentition can be a daunting task for dental and oral
        health science students - and even some qualified dentists! The
        variability in mixed dentition can make the task of charting, in a
        limited amount of time, confusing. We would like to improve the
        confidence of dental students so that they feel comfortable treating
        paediatric patients.


        ![](/img/panoramic-radiograph-showing-patients-dentition-in-the-mixed-dentition-phase-with.png)


        Our course is being created by the President (Yasmin) and Vice President (Sabina), along with the expertise and assistance of Dr. Siobhan Barry - an experienced paediatric consultant at the University Dental Hospital of Manchester.


        We aim to make this course applicable to all year groups.
