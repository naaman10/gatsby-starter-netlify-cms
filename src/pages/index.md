subheading: Educating children in oral health & delivering paediatric dental education
description: "MPDSS is a new society created by Manchester University dental
  students. More than 1 in 3 five year olds across Greater Manchester experience
  tooth decay – well above the England national average of 25%. Our society aims
  to educate children in the local area about oral health. We also arrange
  specialist dental talks and courses to aid the learning of dental students.

        One of the core aims of our society is to deliver oral health education
        sessions to primary schools in the Manchester area. "Oral health
        education" entails the exploration of many topics. In our primary school
        sessions we aim to cover: what a healthy diet is, how to take care of
        your mouth, and what to expect when visiting the dentist.

        Another aim of our society is to invite specialists in the field of
        paediatric dentistry to deliver talks to Manchester dental students. We
        find it imperative that dental students are given the opportunity to
        gain early exposure to paediatric dentistry in order to foster interest
        in the speciality and to help them become well-rounded dentists.

      text: "Being able to chart mixed dentition easily is a refined skill and dental
        students can often worry about their competency in regards to this task.
        - This is why our society aims to create and deliver a mixed dentition
        course to dental students (of all year groups) at the University of
        Manchester. "

        It is imperative that parents and caregivers are kept in the loop when
        it comes to their child’s oral health education. It is important that
        caregivers know that their child is being educated by a safe and
        reputable organisation. Click below to find out about how our society
        prioritises child safety and furthering education outside of the
        classroom.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
